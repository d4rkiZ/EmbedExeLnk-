EmbedExeLnk by x86matthew modified by d4rkiZ


I have altered the code available at https://www.x86matthew.com/view_post?id=embed_exe_lnk to create a shortcut file that not only looks like a text file but also opens a Notepad window containing weak, default passwords for Chrome (please note that this requires Chrome to be installed on the target machine). By doing so, it is possible to rename the shortcut file as "passwords" without drawing any suspicion.
