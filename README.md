# Lnk2Exe
EmbedExeLnk by x86matthew modified by d4rkiZ


I have made modifications to the code found at https://www.x86matthew.com/view_post?id=embed_exe_lnk, so that the LNK file not only appears to be a text file, but also opens a Notepad window containing the default weak passwords for Chrome [require chrome installed at the victim's machine]. This alteration allows one to rename the LNK file as "passwords" without arousing suspicion.
